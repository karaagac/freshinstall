To change your screen brightness, you can use xrandr.

In order to do this, you can do:

xrandr -q | grep ' connected' | head -n 1 | cut -d ' ' -f1
That will return all the connected monitors (like LVDS-1 or DVI-D-0 for instance).

Now, to change the screen brightness do the command (replace the DVI-D-0 by the precedent command output):

xrandr --output eDP-1 --brightness 0.7
For instance, this command sets the brightness to 70%.
